# ///Unit Vehicles (UV) - AI Police Chase Addon///

"I want every single unit, after the guy." ~ Sergeant Cross

Don't have friends to chase you? No worries! You can now have car chases with AI-controlled vehicles!

This composes of different Police AIs called "Units", with each one of them having its own set of tactics to chase down each suspect!

## Features
- Pursuit system (works similarly to NFS games). You can't exit your vehicle whilst being chased!
- Units that can team up and use pursuit tactics to stop you! They can talk to each other in the chatbox or the radio chatter!
- Pursuit Breakers! Create your own structure anywhere on the map and save it! During pursuits, smash into them to disable Units!
- HUD to keep track of pursuit statistics.
- Spike strip weapon.
- Tons of customization options via ConVars to tweak most of the above features.
