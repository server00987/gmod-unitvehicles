[h1]/// RACE /// CHASE /// ESCAPE ///[/h1]

[b]Unit Vehicles[/b] is a Sandbox-oriented addon that allows players, in both Multiplayer with others or Singleplayer with AI, to engage in high-speed pursuits as or against police and thrilling races on any map.

[h3] Requirements [/h3]
You'll need two addons for Unit Vehicles to work flawlessly:

- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1587455087]Decent Vehicles - Basic AI[/url] is required for AI pathfinding.
- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3389728250]Glide // Styled's Vehicle Base[/url] is used by default UVPD vehicles, and highly recommended for the addon.

[h3] Highly recommended [/h3]
- The [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3515525556]Unit Vehicles Starter Data Pack[/url] contains lots of data content provided by the UV development team and the community. Contains AI Racer Names, Pursuit Breakers, Races, Roadblocks, the **Rockport PD** Preset and various Decent Vehicle waypoints for plenty of maps.
