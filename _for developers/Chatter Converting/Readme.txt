This tool automatically converts all audio files present in the current folder, and all subfolders ahead of itself, to 128 kb bit rate and mono format.

---> Requirements <---
1) Python 3.11 or newer
2) ffmpeg (included)

---> How do I use this? <---
1) Move the .py and .exe files into the folder where you want to convert the audio files ("chatter2/default" for example)
2) Run the .py script!

The audio files will now be converted properly and will work correctly when used in Unit Vehicles!
