Now, you and I have our own rules.^^And, oh, if you're wondering how I got your number, let's just say not everyone out there is your friend. Especially when they need to get their ride out of lock up.^^You have a good night, I'll be seein' ya."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_101	"I'm getting tired of cuttin' you slack. No more Mr. Nice Guy. I'm gonna pound you into the pavement. And, by the time I'm done with you and your ride, there'll be nothin' left.^^Now you better believe that I'll be seein' you."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_102	"Hey! Hey! Homies, look! Can you still say homie? I don't even know - I'm from old school. Hey look, how ya doin'?^^Looks like bein' a good driver doesn't mean you got good taste. I thought you guys were supposed to be all about street rep. What? No, I'm playin', I'm playin'... I don't mean to front like that.^^What's the deal with that ride of yours? Don't you care about how it looks? I mean, man... maybe I can help you out with some pinstripes - my personal favorite.^^I look forward to bustin' you...again, and again, and again... So look, get some rest. I'll be seein' ya."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_105	Seems you found yourself a pass to the backroom of the shop. There you can find parts that haven't even hit the shelf. Sometimes they're parts that no one can get a hold of.^^Look around and pick what you want.
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_110	"So you can run - ain't nothing.^^You may've stomped on those... college kids but out here, on this coast, we can hold our own. Competition is fierce and the police got it wired tight.^^Let's see how you do on my streets."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_111	Looks like you made it back onto my streets.^^Don't get all excited 'cause it don't mean nothin'. The next Blacklist racers aren't gonna roll over as easy. I can't wait to see them rip you up.

0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_122	Your car has been released from impound.
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_123	"Get to the top of the Blacklist & take Razor down. The Blacklist is reached from your Safe house & your in-game engage system. It keeps track of your progress & what's needed to challenge a rival. How?^^RACES – 2 ways: enter by driving to the flag icons on the map and use the engage mechanic OR bring up the Blacklist, enter the Races page & select a race. Either way, you're good to go.^^MILESTONES – Each Blacklist rival will make you prove you can handle the heat before they race you. View the milestones by bringing up the Blacklist & entering the Milestone page.^^BOUNTY - Your bounty level indicates how wanted you are by the police, and affects your notoriety with Blacklist members. It increases by completing milestones, for every second you are in a pursuit - higher heat levels increase it more quickly - and if you happen to immobilize any police vehicles during a pursuit. Your bounty only increases if you get away from the police. You can start a pursuit by accessing the Bounty page on the Blacklist."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_124	"The Rockport police are always looking for street racers. Here's some advice:^^DISTANCE - to escape, get some distance between you & the police. Until you're out of their sight, you can't get away. Take a route where you can make some quick moves & use traffic to your advantage to lose the police. Don't assume you can outrun them on the highways.^^HIDING - once you're out of sight, the police will be looking for you. Find a hiding spot or watch your radar & stay away from the police for a while. Hiding spots appear as blue circles on your minimap.^^PURSUIT BREAKERS - if the police are hot on your tail, look for the pursuit breakers that can quickly lose the police. Pursuit breakers appear as triangles on your minimap.^^BACKUP - whenever the cops following you are getting low on numbers, they'll call for backup. Make sure you get out of sight before the backup arrives or you'll have more police to deal with. You can see the backup timer on the pursuit bar."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_125	"Now that you've beat Sonny, the local shops are gonna help you out with parts and upgrades to your ride. There'll be new cars to buy too, if you're interested.  ^^Remember to choose smart 'cause cash ain't always easy to earn. Plan out which cars you want and what upgrades you're gonna make. Don't assume you can buy everything or that drivin' a stock car will get you to the top."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_126	"Taz just sent me a list of the races and milestones that you need to beat to get a shot at his Blacklist position.^^Taz isn't new to this game so you're gonna have to prove you're ready to race him by winning races, beating the milestone challenges and racking up more bounty with the police."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_127	"The police track your car. To make it to the top of the Blacklist you gotta have a bunch of cars to drive.^^When the heat on one car is gettin' high, park it. As you win races and evade the cops with another ride, the parked car will lose heat.^^Backup cars are also cool to have in case your favorite ride gets impounded. If you don't have a car to drive -- it's game over.^^You need to plan what cars you want and which cars you're gonna upgrade, or else you'll run out of money. Remember, if you're really tight for cash you can always sell one of your cars."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_128	"By now I'm thinkin' you're using the Pursuit Breakers to ditch the cops. Here's the deal on gettin' the most outta the Pursuit Breakers.^^Don't use 'em if you don't need to. You might get a few laughs by makin' the donut fall down, but save it for when the cops are on your tail and you need some breathing room, or when you're tryin' to lose the last one before backup arrives.^^Learn where the police are in the world and plan your route so that you drive by as many of 'em as possible. When you get to the Pursuit Breaker make sure you got a lot of cops close by you. Makes no sense if they're way behind or in front of you. If you time it right you can get 'em all with one Pursuit Breaker."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_129	Now that you have access to the Rap Sheet remember to check it out and see what info' the cops have on record. You can access the Rap Sheet from your Safe House.^^Check out the Rankings section in the Rap Sheet and you can see how you're doin' against the other Blacklist rivals in pursuit stats.
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_130	"Speedtrap racing is a little different than other types of races, gettin' across the finish line first doesn't determine the winner.^^The goal is to get the highest total speed recorded through a series of speedtraps. You need to plan your routes to make sure you're at maximum speed when you drive past 'em. Some of the traps are gonna be at the end of a corner -- slow down so you don't hit the walls and then hit the gas quickly.^^Your radar detector will warn you about any upcoming speedtraps. When it goes off, it's usually a good time to use your nitrous for that extra boost of speed."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_132	"Pay attention to the heat of the car you're drivin', each car you own has its own heat level. The best way to keep the cops off your back is to make sure you don't let your heat get too high for the car you're drivin'. Each time your heat moves up a level, police tactics and vehicles step-up too.  ^^You can cool your ride's heat by driving a different car and by winning races or evading pursuits. If you wanna cool-it-down faster, change its look -- different paint, body kits, spoilers, etc. Not all changes make the same difference, but they all help.^^Remember, if you're gonna lower the heat of a car then make sure you drop it down a level for the best results against the cops."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_133	"Once your heat gets high enough the police start blocking the roads to try and stop you. Each roadblock will have its weak point. Some of the roadblocks won't cover the entire road, so the best way is to go around the cars. For the roadblocks that have the road covered, look for the sawhorses, they're usually a weak spot.^^If you come 'round a corner and find a roadblock, don't forget to use Speedbreaker to get a little extra time to manoeuvre before hittin' the block. Aim for the cars in the back half, they're lighter weight and provide a better chance of escape.^^At the higher heat levels watch out for the spike strips. If it looks like there's no car blocking part of the road take a closer look. You might be getting tricked into driving over a spike strip which generally ends with you getting busted. The cops call out the location of the spike strips to make sure that other cops don't hit 'em, so keep your eyes and ears open."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_134	"If you're running a little low on cash, you can always go back to races you didn't complete when you were working your way up the Blacklist. Bring up the Blacklist, select one of the defeated rivals, go to the Races page and finish off any races you haven't completed. You can also re-enter races that you've already won to earn more money.^^Your other option is to sell one of your cars. It's a quick way to get some money, but remember, those local car dealers are only gonna give you half the original stock price for your car. Any money you spent tuning it will be gone. If you decide to sell one of your cars, go to the Safe House car select screen, select the car and you can sell it there."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_135	"You can't always run the same setup for every race if you're lookin' to edge ahead of the competition. Think about tuning the characteristics of your car to get the right balance for a specific race or race type.^^Pay attention to your gear ratios. If you're on a tight track with lots of corners, having more acceleration might pay off. If you're ripping up the highways you might want to slide the performance over for more top speed.^^There are lots of options, so don't forget to give 'em a try. Making a smart tuning choice might make the difference between winning and coming in second. You can find the performance tuning in the pause menu."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_136	"You're attracting a lot of attention. Watch the heat level on the car you're driving.^^If you get to heat level 5 your day will suck.  This level of heat attracts the top cops -- heavier SUVs, more aggressive helicopters and your worst nightmare -- Cross' corvette-driving police squad. You don't wanna mess with them if you can avoid it."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_137	"Listen closely 'cause I'm only goin' over this once.^^Whenever you go up against a ranked racer, the pink slips go up for grabs. Now if you win, you get to choose 2 markers. Those markers represent anything from parts to favors to get you outta trouble with the cops. Included somewhere in those markers is the pink slip. You just gotta get lucky and pick the right one.^^Simple, right? We'll see."

0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_11	"What's up poser?^^I'm glad you're puttin' it down out there - I really am, 'cause I can't wait to get a crack at that ride.^^What - didn't anybody tell you? You gotta put your ride on the line to run against a Blacklist racer and that ... yeah that ... is why people aren't stupid enough to do it.^^I'll be waitin'."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_12	Well look what the underground let loose. Let's see how good you do in the daylight.
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_13	"Good run. I like your style.^^Just make sure you watch your back with these guys, alright?^^See ya around."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_15	"Hey, it's me.^^Check out your map. Head up to the location I told you about. I'll meet you there. Later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_16	"I heard what happened. I told ya these guys were dirty. If you're an enemy of Razor's, you're a friend of mine.^^People call me Rog.^^I'll be seein' ya."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_17	"It's your pal Razor.^^Heard you're back in; I hope you enjoyed your vacation. Maybe I should call you sweetheart now, huh? Glad to see you're a sucker for punishment though. And by the way... thanks for the ride.^^Be seein' ya."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_18	"Yo, it's Rog.^^If you need any parts or think you got enough for a new ride, head over to one of the shops. I told them you're a friend, so they should be cool.^^They're on your map. Check it out."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_19	"Hey, what's up? It's Mia.^^Looks like Razor's keepin' tabs on you. I guess he never figured he'd see you again.^^I like the idea that he'll be lookin' over his shoulder from now on.^^Keep layin' it down out there.^^I'll call later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_20	"Hey man, that chump Sonny is lookin' for a run. He's still pretty fresh on the Blacklist, so now's your chance.^^Don't blow it."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_21	"Listen closely 'cause I'm only goin' over this once.^^Whenever you go up against a ranked racer, the pink slips go up for grabs. Now if you win, you get to choose 2 markers. Those markers represent anything from parts to favors to get you outta trouble with the cops. Included somewhere in those markers is the pink slip. You just gotta get lucky and pick the right one.^^Simple, right? We'll see."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_22	"Nice run.^^Alright, here's the deal. Razor's left the borough. He's racin' in Rockport. To get to him, you've gotta go through the ranks of the Blacklist and clean out each area. There's three areas known as boroughs. This here is Rosewood. Camden Beach is on the coast and Rockport is right after it.^^Unless you have enough rep', you can't get into the next level of racin'. To do that, you've got to win. There's no second place here. Just keep plowin' through your objectives until you can challenge a Blacklist racer.^^I'll feed you more info as I dig it up. Later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_23	"Hey, I've got some news about those pursuit milestones. Apparently, these things are thrown out there by Blacklist racers. They're challenges to anyone who thinks they got what it takes to beat their records. If you wanna get your name out there, this is the way to do it.^^The more pursuit milestones you beat, the more notorious you'll become in the Blacklist."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_24	"Yeah, it's Vic here.^^Keep your mouth shut and listen up. It don't matter to me what you got goin' on with the other guys. You just make sure you stay outta my way. These are my streets, you got that?^^You just bow out when you're told and everything will be cool."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_25	"Hey, it's me.^^Look, I'll be straight. I'm all for helpin' someone who's been cheated, but I gotta get somethin' outta this deal. You flush out the Blacklist and I'll provide you with safe houses. In return, you turn a blind eye to any side bets I put down on ya'. It's a perfect deal, you'll see.^^Get that Rog guy to help you out. Just don't let him figure out what's goin' on.^^Later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_26	It's Mia.^^I got some inside info on the cops that might help out. You can lose the cops by ducking out in hiding spots. You just gotta make sure you're outta their line of sight. They're scattered throughout the world. Cruise around and scout 'em out.^^Later.
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_27	"Hey.^When you're being chased by the 5-0, take a look at your map, you'll see a bunch of icons. These are structures you can use to shake the cops off your back. You just smash into them - instant Pursuit Breaker moment. If the cops aren't damaged, they'll probably stop to provide assistance.^^Trust me, they work."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_29	"Your wins have generated some hype and got the attention of Taz. He's the next Blacklist racer. Guy's nuts and a major heat score, so watch yourself. He's waitin' for your call.^^Later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_30	I'm impressed. Taz underestimated you and paid the price. Make sure you never do the same.^^I'll hook up with you later.
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_31	"Hey, you're really holdin' it down out there.^^I can't believe how deep this thing goes. I can't wait to see what the set up is in Camden Beach. I heard the odds might be better. We'll see.^^Keep smokin' these guys out. Razor's out there, it's just a matter of time.^^I'll see ya'."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_32	"Yeah, it's Vic.^^Looks like you can handle your ride.^^Let's just say I made a call and now the cops really want you bad. So, let's see how hot you are now punk."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_33	"Hey, I've been diggin' around and it looks like that Mia chick is layin' a lot of cash on you. I don't like her.^^I also found out that she has a real long record. That means the cops are probably watchin' her. I'd stay away if I was you."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_35	"Hey, it's Rog!^^Here's the deal. The next Blacklist racer holds the key to Camden Beach. Smoke 'm and the next borough is yours.^^I'll see if I can dig something up on him.^^We'll talk later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_36	"Alright, Vic's up. He's the meathead I was tellin' you about - Razor's knock around guy. He's callin' you out.^^Run 'm off the Blacklist. That should send a message to Razor and his crew.^^I'll watch your back until you get this done."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_37	"Hey, it's me.^^I heard you got into Camden Beach. Good work. Looks like that Rog guy is pullin' his weight.^^I hooked you up with another Safe House closer to the coast. It saves you from havin' to drive back to Rosewood. Long way to go if the cops are on your tail.^^Stay alert. You don't want to get caught off guard.^^Later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_38	"Hey, it's me.^^I heard that cop, Cross, is takin' a strong interest in you. He drives a Corvette C6, so watch for it.^^His Street Racin' Unit's on the look out for you. If you see those guys, don't let them surround you. They travel in packs of three and always try to box you in. Trust me, that's how they took me out.^^I'll let you know if anything else comes up."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_40	"Hey. I heard you were rollin' the streets.^^If Rockport is anything like this, you're gonna have a lot of worked rides to take out.^^I hear Razor's been rattlin' a lot of people out there. I wouldn't worry about it though. He's just tryin' to throw you off your game.^^Stay on target. He'll pay soon enough.^^I gotta hook up some numbers on you.^^See ya' later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_41	It's me.^^Looks like that Izzy chick wants to take you on. She's tellin' everybody she's gonna kick you back to Rosewood. I wouldn't let that stand for too long.^^Don't underestimate her just 'cause she's a chick. That girl can drive.^^I'll call you after you take her out.
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_42	Guess Izzy's racin' days are over.^^Keep burnin' 'em up.^^I'll catch you later.
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_43	"Hey, you're really makin' a mark out there.^^I got some info' on that police chopper. If they're on you, just duck out under some cover. They may be fast, but they can't see through objects. Just make sure they don't see you drivin' into the spot or they'll just call in ground units.^^Later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_46	"Alright, Big Lou wants to lock in a race. He's waitin' for you to make a move."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_47	"Hey, it's Mia.^^I just heard from some other racers that the chopper can't fly into certain areas. Something about restricted fly zones. One of them is the airport. If you need to lose 'm, just look for these areas on your map.^^See ya later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_48	"Well, well, well looks like the hero boy is movin' up in the world, huh?^^Don't get too excited punk, you still ain't rollin' my streets. And if I have anything to say about it... you never will."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_49	"Hey, listen up. People are talkin'.^^Now, I know this ain't true, but they're sayin' you're workin' for the cops. Make sure you prove 'em wrong. I'll take care of the guy spreadin' the rumor."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_50	"Hey, it's me.^^There's been a lot of talk goin' around. Bottom line - this is a race to be the best, most notorious driver around. Don't forget that.^^Razor's tryin' to get you off your game. Stick to the plan. Push through to the top and make him pay for what he did, for what he took away from you.^^See ya later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_52	"Alright, you got that Baron guy's attention. He's dying to race you.^^Don't wait."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_53	"Hey, it's me.^^Great run. I'd love to see the look on Razor's face now.^^Keep it up. Rockport is just around the way.^^I gotta go - later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_54	"Hey, you've cracked the top 10. I had no idea the set up on the coast went this deep.^^Keep up the good work. I'll be in touch.^^Later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_55	Earl here - wassup?^^Didn't think it would be easy did ya?^^Let's see you hold it down after the word goes out that you're worth a whole lot of green. See ya fight your way outta that.
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_57	#9's ready.^^He's heard all the hype and the word is he's not so sure he can take you. Jump him right away.^^He's the only guy stoppin' you from gettin' into Rockport.^^Let's get this done.
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_58	It's Mia.^^Way to go. You're officially #9 on the Blacklist. Take a good look around... Rockport City. I hooked up another Safe House for you. It's nearby. Get familiar with the location. You might have to get there in a hurry.^^Later.
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_59	"What's up, it's me.^^Yeah I know that Rog guy - he's watching your back. I'm just wonderin', you know, why's he doin' it.^^It's a little weird if you ask me. But then again, who am I to judge. Maybe you guys met in jail.^^Later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_60	"Hey, I just got word that Razor is paying guys off to take you out. I don't know how deep it goes, so watch yourself. Don't trust anyone until this blows over.^^I'll catch up with you later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_61	It's Mia.^^Can you believe this? I never knew the Rockport set up was so tight. These racers have everything planned out. I rolled these streets for a long time and never knew this was going on. Get out there and see how far this goes.^^I'll catch up with you later.
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_63	Yo! You're up.^^Jewels is ready when you are. She may be a sweet girl but remember - take her out and you're #8 on the Blacklist.
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_64	"Yeah, it's Ronnie here. You think beatin' him was easy? Yeah, we'll see how easy it is when you run against me."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_65	"Hey, it's Mia.^^I heard about Razor's bribes. No one's buyin' it. People are startin' to back off. On top of that, I got a contact with the city that just dropped your heat. As far as the cops are concerned, you're off their list for now - it should give you some breathing room.^^Get back out there and smoke out that Blacklist. Later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_66	"Hey sweetheart, it's Razor.^^In your push to get to me, you've smoked a lot of drivers that had nothin' to do with what happened to ya.^^Now I know you want me, but hey, I'm gonna tell ya somethin', most of 'em are willing to do anything it takes to make you pay. You should remember that when you're rollin' in Rockport."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_69	I heard Kaze's puttin' the word out that she wants a run. That girl's a nut job.^^Get on her and take her out.
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_70	"Hey man!^^You got a serious buzz goin'. I mean, people from all over the place are trackin' what's goin' on. Cops are goin' nuts.^^You have 5 Blacklist racers left and 2 of them are Razor's boys. Stay on track. We're gettin' close.^^See you later."

0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_79	"Hey, #4 on the Blacklist is up. JV's a popular guy with the crowd, so take him out quick and move on.^^Don't let this hang over you too long."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_80	"#4 on the Blacklist. Sounds good doesn't it?^^You should also know that the word on the street is Razor's runnin' scared. Everyone knows what happened. Your business with Razor is just that - your business, no one else's.^^You shouldn't have any other worries from here on."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_81	"Hey, you know who this is.^^Seems that the races in the boroughs are gettin' busted before they start. I mean, the cops are all over the place. Now the last person to go through there was you.^^Let's just say I'm not the only one who's noticed. You better watch your back."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_82	"It's me.^^Look, I know you talked to Razor. Don't let him throw you off. He's just messin' with you. Stay on top of your game. You take care of the racing and I'll take care of the rest. I have plans for him.^^Later."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_84	"Yeah, it's Ronnie. Look, I don't care what they say about ya. I'm gonna wipe ya all over the road!^^I'm ready when you are punk."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_85	"Hey, it's me.^^I see you cracked the top 3. And to think, you got outta jail with nothin' and clawed your way back to the top. Not bad. One more Blacklist driver and Razor is ours.^^I'll see ya."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_86	"Listen up punk. You know who this is, so shut your mouth and open your ears.^^Now you're either helpin' the cops or someone you're hangin' with is, and I don't care either way. But let's see how ya like it when the tables are turned..."
0	AUTO	SMS_MESSAGE_88	"Alright, this is it. #2 on the Blacklist is up for grabs. Toru's waitin' for your call. Chump's drivin' a McLaren. Need I say more?^^Smoke 'm out fast."

0	AUTO	CT_HELP_TURBO	This slider lets you adjust the characteristics of your induction system. Move the slider to the right to shift your torque boost into a higher RPM range. You'll sacrifice boost in the lower RPM ranges but will gain more torque at the top end. This is useful for high speed tracks. Move the slider to the left to spread the torque boost across a larger range of RPM's. This is useful for tighter tracks where you need boost while accelerating out of corners.

You'll sacrifice boost in the lower RPM ranges but will gain more torque at the top end. This is useful for high speed tracks. Move the slider to the left to spread the torque boost across a larger range of RPM's. This is useful for tighter tracks where you need boost while accelerating out of corners.
