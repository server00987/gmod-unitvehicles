0	AUTO	TTRL_PURCHASECAR_1	Cars are split by Tiers, which represent the range of performance. While higher Tiered cars are generally better some racers are Tier-restricted so you should keep at least one in each Tier.\n\nIf you're unsure about buying a particular car, try renting it first. By paying some SpeedBoost, you can rent any car model for a few days.\n\nRental cars are often pre-customized and perform better than the normal version but it's not possible to visually tune a Rental.

0	AUTO	LOADING_TXT_BODY2	Hit “M” to open the World Map. You can use this to see which events are hot with activity, check the event levels and enter racing events around the World.
0	AUTO	LOADING_TXT_BODY3	The range of Powerups is designed for specific areas of the game such as Race, Pursuit etc. If you want to tailor the Powerups to your own gaming style you can edit the settings in the Powerup Console page of the Safehouse.

0	AUTO	LOADING_TXT_BODY5	Want to see what your Friends are up to? Hit “N” to open up the Feed. Here you can see your rank compared to your Friends as well as their recent victories, losses and rewards.
