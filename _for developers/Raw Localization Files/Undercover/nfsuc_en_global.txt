0	AUTO	TIP_DESC_NITROUSOXIDE	No car starts with Nitrous Oxide, so don't forget to add a Nitrous Oxide package to your ride when you unlock Nitrous.  Using Nitrous Oxide for speed boosts will soon become second nature.  Build your speed.  Ride your Nitrous.\n \nThe Nitrous Meter is located on the right of your dashboard next to the speedometer.  Press the Nitrous button to activate.  Hold the Nitrous button to maintain the flow of your Nitrous. Let go of the Nitrous button when you want the speed boost to end.  Once activated, there is a recharge delay before Nitrous can be activated again. Recharge your Nitrous Meter by driving fast and pulling off stylish moves that increase your Zone Points.

0	AUTO	CUST_TUNING_DESC01	To get a jump off the line or rocket out of corners move the slider towards Torque. To get better top end speed move the slider towards Horsepower.
0	AUTO	CUST_TUNING_DESC02	Move the slider towards Soft for a less reactive drive: softer will handle the jumps better.  Move the slider towards Stiff and you will get a more precise and reactive drive.
0	AUTO	CUST_TUNING_DESC03	For shorter bursts of power move the slider towards Strength. If you want longer use of your Nitrous, move the slider towards Duration.
0	AUTO	CUST_TUNING_DESC04	Move the slider towards Loose if you like to powerslide around corners easily. To tighten up your slide, move towards Grip.
0	AUTO	CUST_TUNING_DESC05	Tune towards Acceleration and top speed will slightly decrease, giving you power out of corners. If you are in a race with more straights, tune Drivetrain towards Top Speed.
