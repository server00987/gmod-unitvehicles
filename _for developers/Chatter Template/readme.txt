- Extract and place this under sound/chatter2
- Rename and/or duplicate 'example_pd' folder if you like
- You can also rename and/or duplicate 'airunit' and 'groundunit' folders if you like for added variety
- 'dispatch' and 'misc' folders are already handled by the chatter system, DO NOT RENAME/DUPLICATE THEM
- Example lines shown below are just generic. Be creative when recording new chatter lines. Use your vocabulary! :)

--- DISPATCH ---

*no voice restriction, so it's not just dispatch themself who is talking ... could be roadblock/support units

*during a call, these folders will play in order: 
addressgroup > dispatchcalldamagetoproperty/dispatchcallhitandrun/dispatchcallspeeding/dispatchcallstreetracing > d_location > unitrequest

*when cooldown starts, these folders will play in order: 
dispbreakaway > d_location > quadrant
